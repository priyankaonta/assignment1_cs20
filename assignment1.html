        width="200" height="150" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"> My favorite place is New York because I 
        go there every summer to visit my family! I love trying new restaurants and shopping around New York. My favorite 
        restaurant in New York is Mitr Thai. I love walking in the city at night and seeing all the buildings and night life.
